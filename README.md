# image-analysis-web-application
This full-stack web app lets users log in, upload images or zip folders, search for multiple objects, and view object counts. Built with React and Flask, it features user authentication and integrates AWS Rekognition for image analysis, S3 for storage, and SQLite to manage results and avoid duplicate analyses.
